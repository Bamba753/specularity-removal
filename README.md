#specularity-removal

This repository contains image processing pipe-line for specularity removal for endoscopic images/videos. A method for extracting specular map was adapted and modified from the study [1]. Unfortunately, the data set used in study [1] is not available to test the repository, yet [Hamlyn](http://hamlyn.doc.ic.ac.uk/vision/) endoscopic videos were processed to implement detection and removal methods.
